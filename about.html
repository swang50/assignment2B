        <h2>What is Sakiori?</h2>
        <p>Sakiori is a traditional Japanese fabric made by weaving worn-out cloth into new clothing and other items.</p>
        <h2>Why it matters</h2>
        <p>Sakiori matters because it transforms textile waste into art, preserving tradition while promoting sustainability. Each piece tells a story, supports ethical craftsmanship, and a greener planetâ€”one thread at a time.</p>
        <p>Sakiori provides job opportunities by supporting artisans, weavers, and small-scale craftspeople who specialize in traditional textile work. It creates demand for skilled labor in hand-weaving, fabric repurposing, and sustainable fashion production. Additionally, as a growing eco-conscious industry, it opens roles in design, marketing, and e-commerce for those passionate about ethical fashion. By promoting handmade, locally crafted goods, sakiori businesses help sustain livelihoods and empower communities while keeping a centuries-old craft alive.</p>
